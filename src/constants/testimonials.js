The best part for us was that we didn't have to waste money fixing it up before selling, and we got to keep all of the value of the house because there was no realtor commission.`,

I bought it around 20 years ago and I just didn't have the time to renovate it and start dealing with realtors, inspectors, title companies etc.`,

I gave her a call and she came over the next day with the contractor, they took a look at the house, and emailed me a cash offer. My house was sold within 3 weeks and I got my check from Nava just as we agreed. I was able to pay my debts and start my life all over again.`,

Throughout the process, Ben and his colleagues answered any questions I had and made me feel super comfortable.`,
